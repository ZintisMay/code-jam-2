# code-jam-2

Our plan is to make something, and pass it off to someone every 20-30 minutes. 

That way we'll learn to write code that is more easily readable, and to get used to reading other people's code. 


Typing game requirements:

The player must be able to type, and see what they have typed on the screen
Random words will show up on the screen at an interval
The player will attempt to type the words on the screen
When the player types a word, the word they are typing and the word on the screen are removed

If too many words are on the screen the player loses
If the player manages to survive for 30 seconds, the player wins (or goes to the next difficulty)
